Title: Localizing Your Options
Description: How to support multiple languages in your help and version information.
---

clipr supports localization, both of the help UI generated by
`AutomaticHelpGenerator` and the options themselves. Only the description
of an argument is localizable - the long name of an argument cannot
be localized to prevent issues if a shell script that called your application
were run on a PC under a different locale.

Currently, the UI is only localized in three languages: English, Spanish, 
German, and Portuguese. If you're fluent in another language or see a problem
with the existing translations, please consider adding a translation! More
details can be found in [issue #28](https://github.com/nemec/clipr/issues/28).

To localize an argument description, apply the
`clipr.Attributes.LocalizeAttribute` attribute to the property. Localization
requires a strongly-typed Resources class, provided as the `ResourceType`
property to the attribute. If this attribute is applied to the enclosing class,
the `ResourceType` will be inherited by any properties within unless otherwise
specified. If not provided, the `ResourceName` defaults to 'ClassName' if
applied to a class or 'ClassName_PropertyName' if applied to a property.

```csharp
[Localize(ResourceType = typeof(Properties.Resources))]
public class LocalizationOptions
{
    [Localize]  // Resource Name defaults to LocalizationOptions_TurnOnThePower
    [NamedArgument("turnonthepower", Action = ParseAction.StoreTrue)]
    public bool TurnOnThePower { get; set; }

    [Localize("FileToAdd", typeof(Properties.Resources))]
    [PositionalArgument(0)]
    public string FileToAdd { get; set; }
}
```
